Selenium class2
What is WebElement?
anything we see on the webpage is considered to be a webelements:
buttons textboxes,checkboxes,links;
HTML?
HyperText Markup language
What is DOM?
DOM Stands for Documents Object Model.It is the browser's
internal view(vnytrishniy vyhlyad) of the webpage
Also called as Developer's tools or dev tools
Document-->a simple html document which represents the page
we are inspecting
Object-->any line in HTML is considered to be an Object
Model-->it is just a layout(maket) of the HTML

Locator: it is an address or position of a webelements on the webpage. It is used to
locate or identify webelements on the webpage
8 LOCATORS
1.ID,
2.Name,
3.Tagname,
4.xpath
,5.LinkText,
6.PartialLinkText,
7.CssSelectors,
8.ClassName
Why do we have this 8 locators?
--developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements
--some locators may have duplicate values in different notes
--some locators may not be applicable for the elements we are looking for:
linktext and partiallinktext are only used for links(<a);
"a" tag is also called an anchor tag
if 2 or more elements have same attributes and attributes values, selenium will only interact with the
first element it locates.
